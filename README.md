# HST refinement checker

HST is an open-source refinement checker for the CSP (Communicating Sequential
Processes) process calculus.  The CSP language and the refinement algorithm that
HST implements are both described in [*The Theory and Practice of
Concurrency*](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/bill.roscoe/publications/68b.pdf), by Bill
Roscoe.
